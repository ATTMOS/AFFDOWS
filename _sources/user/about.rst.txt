About AFFDO Platform
======================

AFFDO (Automated Force Field Developer and Optimizer) is an innovative computational infrastructure designed to improve the 
accuracy of the lead optimization phase in structure-based drug discovery (SBDD). At the core of AFFDO is its ability to quickly generate 
reference training datasets through high-throughput *ab initio* calculations and transform them into accurate models 
to significantly enhance the predictiveness of relative binding free energies between ligands and target proteins. 
AFFDO stands out for its novel, automated approach to force field development and optimization, a process 
traditionally known for its complexity and labor-intensity. Its user-friendly design and integration into cloud-based platforms 
ensure ease of use and rapid adoption, making it a valuable asset for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in SBDD.
